# 🔐 Azure Endpoint Strategy: Private Endpoint & Private Link

## 📘 Overview

When working within a **private VNet**, and your resources (VMs, apps, containers) need to securely access Azure services (e.g., SQL, Storage, Key Vault), you should use:

- **Private Endpoint**: A private IP in your VNet that connects to the Azure service.
- **Azure Private Link**: The underlying technology that enables this secure connection over Microsoft’s backbone.

## ✅ Why Use Private Endpoint + Private Link?

| Benefit            | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔒 Security         | Keeps traffic off the public internet                                        |
| 📜 Compliance       | Meets data residency and audit requirements                                  |
| 🧱 Isolation         | Access scoped to your VNet only                                              |
| 🎛️ Control          | You manage DNS, firewall, and access policies                                |

## 🧠 Example: ERP VM Accessing Azure SQL Securely

- **VNet**: `StudentERP-VNet`
- **Subnet**: `AppSubnet`
- **Private Endpoint**: `sql-db-private-endpoint`
- **Target Service**: `studentdb.database.windows.net`
- **DNS Resolution**: `privatelink.database.windows.net`
- **Authentication**: Managed Identity

## 🔍 Private Link vs Private Endpoint

| Term               | What It Is                          | Role in Secure Access                     |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Azure Private Link** | Azure service (network backbone)    | Enables private connectivity to resources |
| **Private Endpoint**   | VNet resource (private IP)          | Your access point to use Private Link     |

> 🔑 Think of Private Link as the tunnel, and Private Endpoint as the doorway in your VNet that opens into that tunnel.

## 🧰 Summary Table: Endpoint Types

| Type              | Scope         | Security Level | Best For                         |
|-------------------|---------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Public Endpoint   | Internet      | Low            | External apps, public APIs       |
| Service Endpoint  | VNet          | Medium         | Internal apps, quick setup       |
| Private Endpoint  | VNet (Private)| High           | Sensitive data, compliance needs |
| Private Link Svc  | Cross-VNet    | High           | Custom services, partner access  |

## 🛠️ Setup Checklist

- [ ] Create Private Endpoint in target subnet
- [ ] Enable Private DNS zone for service (e.g., `privatelink.database.windows.net`)
- [ ] Configure access policies (RBAC, firewall)
- [ ] Validate connectivity from VNet resource
- [ ] Monitor traffic via NSG logs or diagnostics
